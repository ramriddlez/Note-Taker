#Description
The purpose of this project was to modify stater code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON File. The minimum viable product for this application was its ability to create and save notes. As a bonus, we were tasked with adding the DELETE route to the application to handle the deletion of notes. The application meets that bonus requirement. The application is deployed to Heroku.
